# blmol: A script for importing molecular geometries into Blender

blmol defines a molecule object that can be used to import molecular geometries (from a PDB file) into [Blender][]. It can be used to generate space filling, bond-only, and ball-and-stick models. The script includes definitions for simple default materials that can be used. These should be easily customized.

## Installation

Simply copy to Blender's scripts folder.

## Usage

Basic usage is to switch to the Scripting screen layout, then `import blmol`. Create a molecule object with `m = blmol.Molecule()`, then load the geometry with `m.read_pdb('path/to/file.pdb')`. A space filling model can be generated with `m.draw_atoms()` and a stick model with `m.draw_bonds()`. Many options can be changed as documented within the comments (more details to come here).
